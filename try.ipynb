In Word it is possible to specify how many lines of text a drop-cap should use. Because of limitations in ebook technology, this is not possible when converting.  Instead, the converted drop cap will use font size and line height to simulate the effect as well as possible. While not as good as the original, the result is usually tolerable. This paragraph has a “D” dropcap set to occupy three lines of text with a font size of 58.5 pts. Depending on the screen width and capabilities of the device you view the book on, this dropcap can look anything from perfect to ugly.\\n\\nLinks',\n",
       " 'Links\\n\\nTwo kinds of links are possible, those that refer to an external website and those that refer to locations inside the document itself. Both are supported by calibre. For example, here is a link pointing to the calibre download page. Then we have a link that points back to the section on paragraph level formatting in this document.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThere are two approaches that calibre takes when generating a Table of Contents. The first is if the Word document has a Table of Contents itself. Provided that the Table of Contents uses hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it. The levels of the Table of Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word.',\n",
       " 'If no Table of Contents is found in the document, then a table of contents is automatically generated from the headings in the document. A heading is identified as something that has the Heading 1 or Heading 2, etc. style applied to it. These headings are turned into a Table of Contents with Heading 1 being the topmost level, Heading 2 the second level and so on.\\n\\n You can see the Table of Contents created by calibre by clicking the Table of Contents button in whatever viewer you are using to view the converted ebook. \\n\\n\\tDemonstration of DOCX support in calibre\\t1\\n\\n\\tText Formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tInline formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tFun with fonts\\t2\\n\\n\\tParagraph level formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tTables\\t3\\n\\n\\tStructural Elements\\t5\\n\\n\\tFootnotes & Endnotes\\t5\\n\\n\\tDropcaps\\t5\\n\\n\\tLinks\\t5\\n\\n\\tTable of Contents\\t5\\n\\n\\tImages\\t7\\n\\n\\tLists\\t8\\n\\n\\tBulleted List\\t8\\n\\n\\tNumbered List\\t8\\n\\n\\tMulti-level Lists\\t8\\n\\n\\tContinued Lists\\t8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImages',\n",

Inline images are images that are part of the normal text flow, like this image of a green dot . Inline images do not cause breaks in the text and are usually small in size. The next category of image is a floating image, one that “floats “ on the page and is surrounded by text. Word supports more types of floating images than are possible with current ebook technology, so the conversion maps floating images to simple left and right floats, as you can see with the left and right arrow images on the sides of this paragraph.',\n",
       " 'The final type of image is a “block” image, one that becomes a paragraph on its own and has no text on either side. Below is a centered green dot.\\n\\nCentered images like this are useful for large pictures that should be a focus of attention. \\n\\nGenerally, it is not possible to translate the exact positioning of images from a Word document to an ebook. That is because in Word, image positioning is specified in absolute units from the page boundaries.  There is no analogous technology in ebooks, so the conversion will usually end up placing the image either centered or floating close to the point in the text where it was inserted, not necessarily where it appears on the page in Word.\\n\\nLists\\n\\nAll types of lists are supported by the conversion, with the exception of lists that use fancy bullets, these get converted to regular bullets.\\n\\nBulleted List\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nNumbered List\\n\\nOne, with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly\\n\\nTwo',\n",

       " 'The provided documentation excerpts appear to be from guides on different topics, including the use of calibre for e-book conversion and features of a word processing software, likely Microsoft Word. Here is a detailed summary of each excerpt:\\n\\n### LangChain Expression Language\\nThe documentation mentions that LangChain Expression Language is a tool for composing chains in LangChain. However, no further details are provided in the excerpt.\\n\\n### Calibre E-book Conversion Guide\\nThis section of the documentation provides a detailed guide on how to format documents for conversion using calibre, a popular e-book management software. Key points include:\\n\\n1. **Links**:\\n   - **External Links**: Hyperlinks that direct the reader to an external website.\\n   - **Internal Links**: Hyperlinks that navigate to different sections within the same document.\\n   - Both types of links are supported by calibre, facilitating seamless navigation and reference.\\n\\n2. **Table of Contents (ToC)**:\\n   - **Automatic Generation**: If the Word document already contains a ToC with hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it.\\n   - **Indentation Levels**: The levels in the ToC are determined by their left indent in the Word document. Proper indentation is crucial for creating a multi-level ToC in the e-book.\\n\\n3. **Paragraph Level Formatting**:\\n   - **Custom Formatting**: Paragraphs can be customized extensively, including right alignment, borders, and background colors.\\n   - **Hanging Indents**: Useful for poetry or any text that needs to maintain line integrity even on narrow screens. Hanging indents can also be combined with other formatting options like extra top margins.\\n\\n4. **Tables**:\\n   - **Basic Tables**: Simple tables with rows and columns can be included. An example table lists items like books, pens, pencils, highlighters, and scissors along with their quantities.\\n\\n5. **Lists**:\\n   - **Bulleted Lists**: Standard bulleted lists are supported, but fancy bullets are converted to regular bullets.\\n   - **Numbered Lists**: Numbered lists are supported, including those with long lines that demonstrate hanging indents.\\n   - **Multi-level Lists**: Both bulleted and numbered multi-level lists are supported. These can include complex structures with multiple levels of indentation.\\n   - **Continued Lists**: Lists can be interrupted by other content and then resumed, maintaining their numbering or bullet style.\\n\\n6. **Images**:\\n   - **Block Images**: These are images that stand alone as a paragraph without text wrapping around them. They are typically centered and used for large images that need to be a focal point.\\n   - **Image Positioning**: Exact positioning from Word documents cannot be replicated in e-books due to the difference in formatting technologies. Images will generally be centered or float near their insertion point in the text.\\n\\n7. **General Notes**:\\n   - The documentation emphasizes the limitations and capabilities of converting Word documents to e-books using calibre. It highlights the importance of proper formatting in the original document to ensure a smooth conversion process.\\n\\n### Microsoft Word Features Guide\\nThis section of the documentation provides a guide on various features and functionalities available in a word processing software, likely Microsoft Word.

This allows you to change how the picture fits within the document.\\n\\n2. **Table Editing**:\\n   - To add a row or column to a table, click on the desired location within the table and then click the plus sign that appears.\\n\\n3. **Reading View**:\\n   - The new Reading view makes reading documents easier. You can collapse parts of the document to focus on specific text. Additionally, if you stop reading before reaching the end, the software remembers your last position, even if you switch to another device.\\n\\n4. **Inserting Videos**:\\n   - Videos can be a powerful tool to support your points. By clicking on \"Online Video,\" you can either paste an embed code for a specific video or type a keyword to search for a video online that best fits your document.\\n\\n5. **Professional Document Design**:\\n   - To give your document a professional look, the software offers various design options for headers, footers, cover pages, and text boxes. These elements are designed to complement each other. For instance, you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar to create a cohesive and polished appearance.\\n\\nOverall, the documentation provides a concise overview of how to enhance the visual and functional aspects of a document using specific features like layout options for pictures, table editing tools, a new reading view, video embedding, and professional design templates.\\n\\n### Summary\\nThe provided documentation excerpts cover two main topics: formatting documents for e-book conversion using calibre and enhancing documents using features in Microsoft Word.
